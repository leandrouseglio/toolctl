    REQUIREMENTS:\n
    - All listed images should be available on the local docker registry\n
    - Docker should be installed and with permissions to push to the registry\n
    - Aws credentials should be configured (available on ~/.aws/credentials)

    FILE FORMAT:\n
    Each line on the file should correspond to an image with the formats:

    [registry:port/]namespace/imagename:version OR

    imagename:version
